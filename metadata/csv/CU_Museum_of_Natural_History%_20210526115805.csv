A diary book covering this latter period, if one exists, is not included in this collection. During the period of October 13 to November 4, Earl H.

The primary objective of excavations in this area was to collect charred timber for dendrochronological analysis by A. E. Douglass. In addition, the team excavated many burials and grave goods were sent, at least in part, to the University of New Mexico.

During the period of September 17 to October 7, Morris and crew restored the tower at Mummy Cave, Canyon del Muerto. The journal describes these activities and also interactions with visitors including A. V. Kidder. From October 13 to November 4, Earl H. Morris and field crew conducted excavations to the north of Gallup and in the Bennett's Peak area. The primary objective of excavations in this area was to collect charred timber for dendrochronological analysis by A. E. Douglass. In addition, the team excavated many burials and grave goods were sent, at least in part, to the University of New Mexico.
